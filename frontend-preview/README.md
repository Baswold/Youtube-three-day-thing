# Frontend Preview

This is a standalone preview of the Three-Way AI Director interface that works without the backend.

## How to use

Simply open `index.html` in your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Edge recommended).

## What works

- All UI elements and styling
- Session controls (Start/Stop Recording)
- Talk buttons with state changes
- Animated waveform orbs
- Timer
- Transcript log with simulated responses
- All visual feedback and status indicators

## What's simulated

- Health check (always shows "Preview Mode")
- Audio recording (no actual microphone access)
- AI responses (pre-written sample text)
- Audio playback (no actual audio)

## Purpose

This preview lets you see and interact with the interface design without needing to:
- Set up API keys
- Run the Node.js server
- Configure microphone permissions
- Install dependencies

Perfect for design review, layout testing, or showing the UI to others!
