# Frontend preview

Standalone click-through mock of the Three-Way AI Director interface. The preview mirrors the production layout but replaces network calls with deterministic sample data so that anyone can review the UX without API credentials.

## Launching the preview

1. Open `index.html` directly in any modern desktop browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Edge work best).
2. Interact with the controlsâ€”session management, talk buttons, timers, and waveform orbs behave exactly like the live client, minus the real audio pipeline.

No build step or local server is required; the preview runs entirely from static assets.

## Simulated behaviour

| Feature | Preview behaviour |
| ------- | ----------------- |
| Health check | Status banner is locked to **Preview Mode**. |
| Audio capture | Microphone permissions are never requested and no audio is recorded. |
| AI responses | Transcript entries are generated from curated sample turns to illustrate pacing and formatting. |
| Playback | Buttons animate but no audio is played. |

## What you can evaluate

- Visual design, colour palette, and component spacing.
- Button states, hover/focus outlines, and accessibility labelling.
- Transcript cadence and how turn-taking is communicated to the host.
- Responsiveness when resizing between laptop and tablet breakpoints.

## Customising the preview

- Update `script.js` to swap in different scripted responses.
- Adjust colours and layout in `styles.css` to try brand variations.
- Add annotations or highlight flows by editing the DOM in `index.html`.

Because the preview is static, you can host it from any CDN or simply share the folder over cloud storage when gathering feedback from collaborators.
